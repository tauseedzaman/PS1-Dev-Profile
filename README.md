#### â­• <a name="touch">Create or Touch File, just like touch command in unix envirement</a>

```sh

#### â­• <a name="phpserve">Start PHP built-in web server</a>

```sh
phpserve <port>
```

#### â­• <a name="pyserve">Start Python HTTP server</a>

```sh

#### â­• <a name="gt">Navigates to a specified folder based on partial name</a>

```sh
gt <some-folder>
```
The `gt` function searches for a folder whose name matches the specified partial name. If multiple matches are found, it prompts you to select one. Once a unique match is determined, it navigates directly to that folder.

Before Using `gt`:
Before using the `gt` function, it's recommended to run the Scane-Folders function. This function scans your user home directory and stores the paths of all subfolders in a file called folderPaths.txt. This file is used by the `gt` function to quickly locate folders based on partial names.

To update folder paths, run:

```sh
Scane-Folders
```

*Example:*

Suppose you want to navigate to a folder named "Documents" within your user directory, but you're not sure of the full path. You can simply use gt followed by the partial name:

```sh
gt Documents
```
If multiple folders with "Documents" in their names exist, `gt` will display them and prompt you to select the desired one. After selecting, you will be navigated to the chosen folder
